## RECURSION

- A process (a function) that calls itself.
- A recursive functions should always have a base case and be invoked with different input each time
- When using recursion, it's often essential to return values from one function to another to extract data from each function call
-

# How recursive functions work

Invoke the same function with a different input until you reach your base case!
